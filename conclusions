u have to set a min and max limit for hosts count, otherwise new hosts won't be able to connect.

a.bad_guys_ratio=0.01 # 1% of bad guys screw the network
-> makes sense : if an info can't be verified, then the first one to send it is right

if i'm like : my peers blockchain is bigger, i add new blocks to mine
well i can't do that, because these blocks might be not accepted
to work around that, i could just duplicate the whole blockchain, so the longest would win, but that would take ages
so i need to maintain a list of unvalidated blocks, and take other's blockchain going n blocks back, in case they are diff
i also shouldn't take a block that doesn't follow mine
