each peer have a sort of time, but that can varies, so here, we'll 
assign for each peer a 'delay', taht will be -1 for each loop
and in that loop, we are like 'do_that_task'
and once the task done, each host calculate an average of the result from each peer it's connected
and each peer should have the same result, approx. well actually it has to.
actually we calculate a random
then we gather all randoms from other, and with our own we do an avg, and that is the result
and then we repeat, till the random is table
and that mean each of us should have a proper random number
meaning that from here we can decide the next block to come
list of proposed block should be stored
and with that list we pick a random into one
so :

- procedure called tick that does whatever has to be done
- each tick :
 - host tries to mine a block
 - if some host found a block, it adds to its chain
 - each host asks the other (or the other tells ones) their blockchain status
	- each host telling the other to which its connected makes more sense because it can react in real time to a chain update
  - but also a host reconnecting to the network should be able to ask
  - maybe a host should tell its blockchain if :
   - it was updated
   - it was asked
 - if one host sees two diff blockchains (it asks for the last, and the one before, till it converges), it takes the longuest

- then we'll add difficulties and everythg into a blockchain, that will be a type
and a blockchaincompare to compare two blockchaine
and we'll have everythg
and we'll emulate cheaters who pretend to solve a block no pb


-- but for now, i'll use my network to just do a calculation, and find out the result
i'll emulate computers who are fasters than other with ticks
and i'll get the result of everybody


on se connecte à un seul host, mais on a une liste des autres si celui là tombe ?


when we create a new host, it can connects to any host that doesn't overpass its connection limit
there is a min connection that it will try to go over
and a max connection

so when new host, we give it a list of possible hosts, or maybe a beginning list, but based on what ?





adding random host = 
adding host, pick a random one that doesn't reach its max connection (random then loop)

check : add hosts till min_host is reached. 
adding host : try add host if other doesn't reach max_host



---
pick n random host, between 0 and 1% of the peer pool
assume they find a proper new block
they add the block
the other ask them : any new block ? (comparing the length of the blockchain with all other nodes)
they say yes
the one which asked get the new blocks (could be multiples at once, it means just append new blocks)
and before appending them, it check them, if the sha is correct 

sha will be a True False in my experiment


and the bad guy will try to send bad blocks, they won't be able too

and if a host has two blocks, it gets the block in the longest chain

but that's wrong, because i could add like n blocks to a chain, it will become the most known... how to avoid that ????

well, that's the whole point, if it makes sense, it's right

so :
i'm a host.
i don't calculate blockchain, it's another process
i ask the other : what's the lenght of your blockchain
if > me, then i build a list of these hosts
for each, i ask the blocks that i'm missing
for each block, i check if it's ok
if all blocks are ok, then i add the blocks to myself



what method to use to properly sync blockchain ?
well, first let's try refusing other's blocks if they can't find on my chain

and with that, i should have nodes who can't sync anymore
